# VEX Use Case 10

| Single Product | Multiple Versions (Individual) | Single Vulnerability | Affected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

A VEX states that CVE-2020-25649 is not exploitable in Acme Product versions 2.2.0 through 2.4.0.

### Note
This case is identical to [Case-4](../Case-4) with the exception that this case specifies individual versions
rather than a range. As a result, this example is more verbose than Case-4, as each version is individually
specified.
