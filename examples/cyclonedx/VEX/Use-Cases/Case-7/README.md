# VEX Use Case 7

| All Products | All Versions | Single Vulnerability | Not Affected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

A VEX states that CVE-2020-25649 is not exploitable in any current version of any product made by a 
particular software developer.

This example is a bit vague, as the metadata section doesn't state which component (product) the VEX is
applicable to. In reality, the VEX should be applied to a group of SBOMs, similar to [Case-6](../Case-6).
