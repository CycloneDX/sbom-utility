# VEX Use Case 13

| Multiple Products | All Versions | Single Vulnerability | Affected and Not Affected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

A VEX states that CVE-2020-25649 is not exploitable in all versions of Acme Product 1 and Acme Product 2, but is exploitable in all versions of Acme Product 3.

In this example, there are three products and an SBOM for each. The inventory of bom-1, bom-2, and bom-3 was
intentionally omitted for simplicity of the example.
