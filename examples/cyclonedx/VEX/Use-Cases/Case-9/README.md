# VEX Use Case 9

| Multiple Products | All Versions | Multiple Vulnerabilities | Not Affected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

A VEX states that none of the collection of vulnerabilities known as Ripple20 is exploitable 
in any of a supplierâ€™s current product versions.

In this example, there are three products and an SBOM for each. The inventory of bom-1, bom-2, and bom-3 was
intentionally omitted for simplicity of the example.
