| --- | --- | --- | --- |

A VEX states that CVE-2020-25649 is not exploitable in any current version of a family of products made 
by a particular manufacturer.

In this example, there are three products and an SBOM for each. The inventory of bom-1, bom-2, and bom-3 was
intentionally omitted for simplicity of the example.
